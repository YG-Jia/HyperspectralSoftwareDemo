# A simple software for processing hyperspectral data
## Introduction
This is the source code of our data processing tool that  we use in our [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02698-1_47) 
 for processing hyperspectral data.

Our paper:[Apple Surface Pesticide Residue Detection Method Based on Hyperspectral Imaging](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02698-1_47) 

It still has some bugs to fix and some features to be implemented. 

The code written at the time was very messy. Recently, I will try to make the code clearer to read and easier to maintain.

## Requirements
- Python3
- PyQt5
- numpy
- pandas
- python-opencv

## ToDo List
- [ ] Rearrange the code structure, make it easier to maintain
- [ ] Rewrite the code of manually select the ROI(Region Of Interest)
- [ ] Support 'bil' format hyperspectral data
- [ ] ...


## Finished
- [x] Read and display basic information of 'raw' format data 
- [x] Display spectral curve
- [x] Select a region of interest (Our target is Apple, so we use Hough Circle Transform)
- [x] Category classification(Also designed for our work)
- [x] ...

## How To Run
The source code was already tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and deepin 15.10.

```bash
python Main.py
```
