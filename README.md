# A simple software for processing hyperspectral data
## Introduction
This is the source code of our data processing tool that  we use in our paper [(Apple Surface Pesticide Residue Detection Method Based on Hyperspectral Imaging)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-02698-1_47) for processing hyperspectral data.

It still has some bugs to fix and some features to be implemented. 

The code written at the time was very messy. Recently, I will try to make the code clearer to read and easier to maintain.

## Requirements
- Python3
- PyQt5
- numpy
- pandas
- python-opencv

## How To Run
```bash
python Main.py
```
